## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/web`
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/angular`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/community) you could add.

## Generating React Application

Run `nx generate @nrwl/react:application` to generate an application.

## Generating Angular Application

Run `nx generate @nrwl/angular:application` to generate an application.

## Build Stencil Web Component

Run `nx build web-component` to build stencil web component.

## Development server

Run `nx serve` with app name (ex:angular-app, react-app, web-component) for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
